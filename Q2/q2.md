## QUESTION

â€‹Consider a group of 40 people in a room who wish to be able to establish pairwise secure communications in the future. How many keys need to be exchanged in total:

(a) Using symmetric cryptography?<br/>
(b) Using public key cryptography?

## ANSWER

### Part (a)

Each person has to establish a symmetric key with another person. Hence, the total number of symmetric keys that need to be exchanged is:

N = 40 * 39 / 2 = 780


### Part (b)

Each person needs a public key and a private key. Each person only needs to publish his/her public key. Hence, the total number of symmetric keys that need to be exchanged is:

N = 40
