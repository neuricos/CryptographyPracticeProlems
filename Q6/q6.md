# Q6

## QUESTION

Consider an insecure version of SSH that uses ECB mode for encryption. Whenever a user types a key into the ssh client, that key is immediately encrypted and sent over the wire to the server. This immediate encrypt-after-key-press procedure is what enables the interactivity of a remote shell. Now consider the following sequence of plaintext packets (written in hex):

```
 P1 = 6C 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  // ASCII l
 P2 = 73 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  // ASCII s
 P3 = 20 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  // ASCII space
 P4 = 2A 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  // ASCII *
 P5 = 2D 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  // ASCII -
 P6 = 66 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  // ASCII f
 P7 = 72 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  // ASCII r
 P8 = 6F 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  // ASCII o
 P9 = 6D 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  // ASCII m
P10 = 0D 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  // ASCII <enter>
```

This corresponds to a user typing "`ls *-from<enter>`" into their ssh client.
Suppose an attacker knows what the user is typing via some out-of-band channel (e.g., shoulder surfing) and also eavesdrops on this communications and intercepts the corresponding ciphertexts:

```
 C1 = 4E B6 48 B2 E0 BE A5 B1 21 2F 07 54 DF CF A4 39
 C2 = 11 70 78 65 88 89 06 62 82 0C 0A 6A 55 6F 87 46
 C3 = EF 7F 1F 25 3E 99 98 8D 1A FD BE 7A D9 D6 ED 7E
 C4 = 5B 40 2B 18 0B 94 E8 13 DA F3 DE 21 A0 27 2E C4
 C5 = 93 80 19 1F 06 B4 4B 19 9D 70 86 28 34 12 26 DC
 C6 = 68 74 EB 1B 16 5F 70 45 05 29 B9 66 0A CC D3 6C
 C7 = 56 E8 77 E1 7E BF 01 19 27 87 03 FE E1 1D 65 A8
 C8 = 9D 37 51 F0 68 C8 F7 BA 44 B2 E9 5C 09 94 1D 5A
 C9 = 62 30 38 8F A4 D7 C1 56 68 88 CE 2C 29 2D F5 23
C10 = D5 89 74 7E 45 89 08 FA 5B 63 98 42 E6 B2 31 85
```

The attacker can now inject messages into the communications channel from the client to the server. One thing an attacker might try to do: generate a sequence of ciphertext packets that, when decrypted, are interpreted as "`rm -rf *<enter>`" on the server. Give such a sequence of ciphertext packets in your answer.

## ANSWER

Reorder the encrypted ciphertext corresponding to the plaintext to create the target command.

```
56 E8 77 E1 7E BF 01 19 27 87 03 FE E1 1D 65 A8  // ASCII r
62 30 38 8F A4 D7 C1 56 68 88 CE 2C 29 2D F5 23  // ASCII m
EF 7F 1F 25 3E 99 98 8D 1A FD BE 7A D9 D6 ED 7E  // ASCII space
93 80 19 1F 06 B4 4B 19 9D 70 86 28 34 12 26 DC  // ASCII -
56 E8 77 E1 7E BF 01 19 27 87 03 FE E1 1D 65 A8  // ASCII r
68 74 EB 1B 16 5F 70 45 05 29 B9 66 0A CC D3 6C  // ASCII f
EF 7F 1F 25 3E 99 98 8D 1A FD BE 7A D9 D6 ED 7E  // ASCII space
5B 40 2B 18 0B 94 E8 13 DA F3 DE 21 A0 27 2E C4  // ASCII *
