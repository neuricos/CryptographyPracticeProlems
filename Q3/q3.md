# Q3

## QUESTION

â€‹This message was encrypted with the RSA primitive, where `N=33` and `e=3`. Decrypt it and submit the corresponding plaintext.

**Tips:** You are welcome to write a program to aid in the decryption, and you might want to compute the private decryption exponent `d`.

For this cryptogram 'A' is encoded as a 1 before encryption, 'B' as a 2, and so on.

Here is the cryptogram:

```
24 28 1 3 28 22 26 24 16 4 9 23 26 24 18 21 12 1 5 31 21 28 26 18 21 12 3 5 27 24 16 4 14 9 13 24 1 4 17 16 3 18 21 28 26 31 27 9 24 24 26 27 14 12 16
```

## ANSWER

The message is as follows:

```
R S A I S V E R Y P O W E R F U L A N D U S E F U L I N C R Y P T O G R A P H Y I F U S E D C O R R E C T L Y
