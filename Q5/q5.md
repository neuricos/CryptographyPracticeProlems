## QUESTION

Suppose you, as an attacker, observe the following 32-byte (3-block) ciphertext C1 (in hex)

```
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 03
46 64 DC 06 97 BB FE 69 33 07 15 07 9B A6 C2 3D
2B 84 DE 4F 90 8D 7D 34 AA CE 96 8B 64 F3 DF 75
```

and the following 32-byte (3-block) ciphertext C2 (also in hex)

```
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 03
46 79 D0 18 97 B1 EB 49 37 02 0E 1B F2 96 F1 17
3E 93 C4 5A 8B 98 74 0E BA 9D BE D7 33 AD 85 34
```

Suppose you know these ciphertexts were generated using CTR mode, where the first block of the ciphertext is the initial counter value for the encryption. You also know that the plaintext P1 corresponding to C1 is

```
43 72 79 70 74 6F 67 72 61 70 68 79 20 43 72 79
70 74 6F 67 72 61 70 68 79 20 43 72 79 70 74 6F
```

Compute the plaintext P2 corresponding to the ciphertext C2. Submit P2 as your response, using the same formatting as above (in hex, with a space between each byte). For fun, you are welcome to look at what P2 represents in ASCII.

## ANSWER

P2

```
43 6f 75 6e 74 65 72 52 65 75 73 65 49 73 41 53
65 63 75 72 69 74 79 52 69 73 6b 2e 2e 2e 2e 2e
```

P2 in ASCII

```
C o u n t e r R e u s e I s A S
e c u r i t y R i s k . . . . .
```
