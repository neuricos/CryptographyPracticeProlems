## QUESTION

The goal of this task is to give you a better understanding of ​Certificate Authorities​ (CAs) and certificates.

Take a look at the CAs certificates that your computer trusts.

- Mac: Spotlight search 'Keychain Access'. Open the Keychain Access app and inspect the "System Roots" keychain.
- Windows: Control Panel -> Search 'Internet Options' -> Content -> Certificates (and then look at the various tabs)

Answer these questions:

1. How many root CA certificates does your computer have?
2. What is something that you found interesting from looking at the root CA certificates?
3. Go to google.com using your favorite browser, and find a way to look at the certificates for google.com. List the chain of certificates your browser sees.
4. What is a possible risk of trusting a CA?

## ANSWER

### Part (1)

My computer (Mac) has 172 root CA certificates.

### Part (2)

Each of the certificates has an expiration time.

### Part (3)

`GlobalSign -> GTS CA 101 -> *.google.com`

### Part (4)

If a legitimate CA is hacked, then every site signed by that CA will be trusted. Hackers can create fishing sites and make the compromised CA sign the sites and deceive the users.
