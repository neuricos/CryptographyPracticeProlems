## QUESTION

Consider a Diffie-Hellman key exchange with `p=29` and `g=2`. Suppose that Alice picks `x=4` and Bob picks `y=6`. What will each party send to the other, and what shared key will they agree on?

## ANSWER

The message Alice would send is `g^x mod p = 2^4 % 29 = 16`

The message Bob would send is `g^y mod p = 2^6 % 29 = 6`

They will agree on `g^(x * y) mod p = 2^(4 * 6) % 29 = 20`
