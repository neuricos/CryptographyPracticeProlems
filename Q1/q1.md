## QUESTION

What is the main concern cryptographers have with the Encrypt-and-MAC method for combining a symmetric encryption scheme with a symmetric MAC to create a symmetric authenticated encryption scheme?

## ANSWER

MAC is deterministic. Two messages will produce the same MACs, indicating the fact that the messages are equal. Hence, Encrypt-and-MAC does not preserve confidentiality.

For example, Bob sends a message M, which is later encrypted to be C, to the Bank and Eve is eavesdropping on the wire. Since Eve knows what message would produce the same MAC as the one in C (by testing), she would essentially know what the message M is. One thing she can do is to replicate C and send it again (e.g., M means "Transfer $100") when she wants.
